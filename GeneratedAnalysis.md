Based on the given file structure, it is difficult to determine the exact programming language and framework used to build this application. However, we can make some assumptions based on the file extensions and common conventions.

The file extensions ".mjs" suggest that this project might be using JavaScript or a JavaScript-based language like TypeScript. The presence of "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files indicates that this project is likely using a package manager, such as npm or Yarn, which is commonly used in JavaScript projects.

The directory structure suggests that this might be a monorepo consisting of multiple codebases. Here is a breakdown of the possible roles of each directory:

- `commands`: This directory might contain scripts or modules related to command-line operations or tasks.
- `utils`: This directory might contain utility modules or helper functions used throughout the codebase.
- `index.mjs`: This file is likely the entry point of the application or a module that exports the main functionality.
- `openai.mjs`: This file might be related to the OpenAI integration or API calls.
- `prompts.mjs`: This file might contain predefined prompts or templates used in the application.
- `directoryProcessor.mjs`: This file might be responsible for processing directories or handling file operations.

To understand the dependencies of this codebase, you can look into the "package.json" file. It should contain a list of dependencies and their versions. You can also check the "package-lock.json" file for a more detailed description of the installed packages and their dependencies.

To get started with this codebase, you can read the "README.md" file. It usually contains instructions on how to set up and run the application. Additionally, you can explore the "index.mjs" file to understand the main functionality of the application.
