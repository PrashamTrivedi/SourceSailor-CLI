Based on the given file structure, it is difficult to determine the exact programming language and framework used to build this application. However, we can make some assumptions based on the file extensions and common conventions.

The file extensions ".mjs" suggest that this project might be using JavaScript or a JavaScript-based language like TypeScript. The presence of "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files indicates that this project is likely using a package manager, such as npm or Yarn, which is commonly used in JavaScript projects.

The "README.md" file is typically used to provide information and instructions about the project, so it would be a good starting point to understand the purpose and usage of the application.

The "commands" directory suggests that this project might have a command-line interface (CLI) or some kind of command-based functionality. The files inside this directory, such as "analyse.mjs" and "listModels.mjs", likely contain the implementation of these commands.

The "utils.mjs" file might contain utility functions or helper code that is used throughout the application.

The "index.mjs" file is often the entry point of a JavaScript application, so it might be a good file to start with to understand the overall structure and flow of the codebase.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine if this project is a monorepo or if there are any specific dependencies. To understand the dependencies of this codebase, you would typically look for a "package.json" file, which lists the project's dependencies and their versions.
