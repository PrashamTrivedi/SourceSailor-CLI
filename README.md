# SourceSailor

Navigate through your source code with ease.


## About

This is the CLI that reads your source code and generates a report that will help someone getting started with it and undersetanding the codebase..

## :warning: Disclaimer

This is an experimental work in progress. I am still exploring all the possibilities. You can check [GeneratedAnalysis.md](GeneratedAnalysis.md) to see what the CLI can generate at the moment using OpenAI.

## :construction: Next Steps

- Iterate through prompts
- Use Openrouter to switch models
- Use more prompts and CoT to work around the project 
- Use tree sitter to get better ideas of the project and codebase :brain: (Can be core functionality of the CLI)
- Write some reports per prompt and then pass it to CoT to generate a confident report
- Use the report as RAG. :bulb: (Highly speculative)
